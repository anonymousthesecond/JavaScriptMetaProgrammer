# JavaScriptMetaProgrammer

Welcome to the JavaScriptMetaProgrammer! This tool empowers you to dynamically generate code snippets and structures in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Code Template**: Define flexible code templates with placeholders to inject custom values.
- **Code Builder**: Construct code dynamically with support for indentation and control flow.
- **Code Generator**: Generate function and class definitions effortlessly using provided templates.
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure the reliability and correctness of the code with comprehensive unit tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

### Installation

To install the JavaScript code generation tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash

### Usage

1. Include the necessary classes in your JavaScript code:

   ```javascript
   const CodeTemplate = require('./CodeTemplate');
   const CodeBuilder = require('./CodeBuilder');
   const CodeGenerator = require('./CodeGenerator');
   ```

2. Create code templates, build code dynamically, and generate function/class definitions using the provided classes.

   ```javascript
   // Example: Generate function definition
   const functionDefinition = CodeGenerator.generateFunction('add', 'a, b', 'return a + b;');
   console.log('Function Definition:');
   console.log(functionDefinition);
   ```

3. Run the code:

   ```bash
